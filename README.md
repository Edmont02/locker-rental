# locker-rental
For this personal project, I wanted to create a hash table. To implement this logic, I chose to make a locker rental system. 

Let's break this project down a bit. Here are the anticipated project requirements:
1. Specify the number of lockers available for the locker rental company
2. Keep track of lockers that are in use and those that are available to rent
3. When renting a locker -- give the user a randomly generated number combination to access their locker
4. The user will need this code to open their locker and place up to 3 items inside (this part is just for fun!): jacket, bag, car keys
5. When the user is done with the locker -- the locker will go back to available and the combination code given to the previous user will be disabled for use for a specific time frame

More details to come very soon. Working on an implementation plan for this. I believe I can have this project completed by November 1st, 2025.
